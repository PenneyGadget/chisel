-- Start with MD strings
-- split up the string in a reasonable way to find the tags
-- detect the tags for each line and change it accordingly to html
-- be careful of order - i.e. did you turn one thing into something that
-- may get accidentally changed in the next step - (*) header, paragraph, em, strong, ul, ol

    HTML
-- line 1\n line 2\n line 3\n
-- [
      [line 1],
      [line 2],
      [line 3]
    ]

    MD
-- line 1\n line 2\n line 3\n

ruby lib/chisel.rb markdown_file html_file

in Ruby file: ARGV[0] = markdown_file
"x" = markdown_file
(this is your File.read)

ARGV[1] = html_file
(this is your File.write)

needs to read in MD -> parse -> change to HTML

think about
  .split("\n")
  .split("\n\n")
  .join ("\n")

  iterate through indexes in returned array

  top of the file: require 'file path' (to use methods from other files with Class.new)
